I want to transform my current React/TypeScript AI chat application into a fully functional, production-ready SaaS AI tool for enterprise customers.

Please:

Refactor and modularize the codebase for scalability and maintainability.
Add user authentication (with enterprise SSO options like SAML/OAuth2).
Implement multi-tenant support (each company/customer has isolated data and settings).
Add a robust backend (Node.js/Express or Next.js API routes) with a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for storing users, organizations, chat history, and persona configurations.
Integrate billing/subscription management (Stripe or similar).
Add admin dashboards for organization/user management and analytics.
Ensure secure API endpoints and proper data validation.
Add environment-based configuration and logging.
Make the UI responsive and accessible, with enterprise branding options.
Add audit logging and GDPR-compliant data controls (export/delete).
Provide API endpoints for enterprise integration (webhooks, data export, etc).
Add unit and integration tests.
You are allowed to make direct changes to my code, create new files, and scaffold new modules as needed.
Please provide code snippets or full files for each major change, and explain any architectural decisions.
